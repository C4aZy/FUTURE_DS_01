## Data Cleaning
- Removed null and inconsistent values
- Standardized date and category formats
- Aggregated daily data for trend analysis
- Validated revenue and conversion metrics

## Assumptions
- Conversion rate = purchases / views
- Revenue aggregated at category level
- October 2019 analyzed as a standalone month

## Analytical Approach
1. Time-series analysis for revenue trends
2. Category-wise aggregation for performance comparison
3. Conversion rate analysis to identify high-intent products
4. Traffic vs conversion analysis to identify opportunities and risks

## Key Findings
- High conversion does not always correlate with high traffic
- Some categories generate strong revenue despite lower visibility
- Certain high-traffic categories underperform in conversion, indicating optimization potential

## Limitations
- Analysis limited to one month
- No demographic or customer-level segmentation
- Pricing and discount data unavailable

## Future Scope
- Month-over-month comparison (Oct vs Nov 2019)
- Product-level deep dive
- Campaign or promotion impact analysis
